**Horiseon Marketing Agency Codebase:**

This is a code base that has been fixed to fit accessibilty standards in order to make the site optimized for search engines, this has been done by editing the HTML and CSS files for the document and ensuring the code is less cluttered and easier to work with. 
In future it would be a good idea to add Javascript functionality to the website in order to make it more functional and responsive.
